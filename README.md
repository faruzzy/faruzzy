j# Hi there ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜„,



I am a fully-stacked TypeScripter who enjoys building consumer-facing websites and apps.

I care deeply about UX, DX, performance and specialize in the tooling + React space and also work with serverless architectures and infrastructures using platforms like Vercel and AWS.
