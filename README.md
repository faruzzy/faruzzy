### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„,

I am a fully-stacked TypeScripter.

My name is Roland and I build consumer-facing websites and apps.

I care deeply about UX, DX, performance, a11y, and SEO. I specialize in the tooling + React space and also work with serverless architectures and infrastructures using platforms like Vercel and frameworks like Serverless.
